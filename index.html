          <h2><i>Mission:</i> To teach and invent techniques to clearly evoke urban data.</h2>
          <p> 
            The past decade has witnessed explosive growth in the world's urban population alongside equally quick growth in digital record-keeping. The Visualizing Urban Data Idealab aims to build on both of these trends, to create a space where participants can learn and invent visual ways to clarify urban data. The IdeaLab hosts speakers, provides guidance in using software and computer languages, and encourages collaboration across departments on projects that exploit UC Berkeley's many strengths in the social and information sciences. The mission is to yield research insights and assist decision-makers who confront the problems facing modern cities.
